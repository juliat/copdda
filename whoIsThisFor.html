  <h1>Who is this website made for?</h1>
  <img src="img/who.jpg"/>
  <p>This website is meant for people who have a lung disease called Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Sometimes COPD is also called chronic bronchitis or emphysema.</p>
  
  <h2>You should use this website if you:</h2>
  <p>• Have COPD</br>
  • Wear oxygen when you are at rest</p>
  
  <h2>This website NOT meant for</h2>
  <p>• People who do not have COPD </br>
  • People with COPD who do not need to wear oxygen at rest.</p>
  
  <p>￼The goal of this website is to help you decide what COPD treatment option is right for you. It focuses on two different options:</p>
  1. To become a lung transplant candidate<br/>
  2. To be treated with medicine only and not be listed for a lung transplantation</p>
  <p>The decision to continue your medicines for your COPD versus choosing to be listed for lung transplantation is a personal decision. There is no medically right or wrong answer. Your values and preferences about how you want to be treated for COPD are important in this decision.</p>
  
  <p>This website will tell you more about the good and bad things about each treatment option.</p>
