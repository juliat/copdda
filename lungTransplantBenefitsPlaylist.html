  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon goOffOxygen">Video 1: Bill</h3>
  <p>I got a transplant 6 months ago. Before my transplant, I was so short of breath that I felt as if I was breathing through a straw. My anxiety would often get the best of me because I never knew when I would. But now, I don’t feel short of breath. I no longer have to carry an oxygen tank everywhere. I can get around the house. I can even take care of my own shopping, cooking and cleaning.  Getting my lung transplant has helped me get my freedom back. </p>
  
  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 2: Robert—Long hospital stay</h3>
  <p>When I went to the lung transplant classes, I found out that if everything went well, I would stay in the hospital for only a week or two.  They told me that there was always a chance that I would have to stay longer. I just didn’t think it would happen to me. </p>
  
  <p>After the transplant, it was hard to get me off the breathing machine because my lungs just wouldn’t work right. The doctors told my wife that I had primary graft dysfunction--PGD.  I was on a breathing machine for 2 months after transplantation. They put a trach here in my throat because I need the breathing machine for so long. They also put feeding tube into my belly because I couldn’t eat when I was on the breathing machine.</p>
  
  <p>When I finally got off the breathing machine I was so weak.  I could barely lift my legs. Even the muscles in my throat were weak and I had to learn how to swallow again.  It took me 6 months to finally get out of the hospital.  It has been 9 months since my transplant and I think I am still weaker than I was before I got a transplant.  </p>
