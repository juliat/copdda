  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon moreControl">Video 1: Mark—Pulmonary rehab made me feel better</h3>
  <p>My doctor prescribed 36 days of pulmonary rehabilitation, where they help you learn about breathing, and exercise, and eating right, and the disease in general. I started going and it was going pretty well, but then I found out that my insurance would only cover 20 days and that I’d have to pay for the rest of the days out of pocket. At first I thought I would stop going after 20 days, but pulmonary rehab helped me feel a lot better. I learned a lot about my drugs and my disease. Learning pursed-lip breathing helped me start doing basic things around the house more easily. Now, at rehab, I also met other patients. I actually met one guy who had gotten a transplant a while back and he was talking about how much the surgery and all his drugs cost. Once I heard the ballpark he was talking about, I stopped thinking rehab was so expensive. </p>

  
  <h3 class="icon lessExpensive">Video 2: Laura—Less burden on the caregiver</h3>
  <p>My son, James, he’s just been a saint through all of this. He checks up on me every day in the morning and after he gets off work. He picks up my groceries, and he cooks for me when I’m not feeling up to it. He’s had to take me to the ER a few times this past year. I’m so grateful for what he does, and so lucky that he still lives near me—my other kids moved out of state. But I worry about being a burden on him. He has a full time job, a wife, and three kids besides taking care of me.</p>

  <p>I had heard some great things about lung transplants, and I thought if I got one I might be able to get back to doing things on my own. I talked about it with my doctor, and he explained that it’s pretty hard on the person taking care of you. They do a ton of work taking care of you and handling everything. He also said it’s—just hard, emotionally.</p>
  
  <p>The doctor said that if I was to get referred for a transplant evaluation, my son would need to take time off work to move close to the transplant center with me. That is 3 hours away from his house! So that made me reconsider if I really wanted to put my son through all of that. He might be willing to do it, but I don’t want him to quit his job or take time off work, and I certainly don’t want him to put his family on the back burner.</p>
  
  <h3 class="icon medicinesBetter">Video 3: Renee—Can live with COPD/I know what it is like</h3>
  <p>I can live with my COPD. Yes, there are times that I am short of breath—but for the most part I can do what I want to do. I love to knit and I love to watch the birds come to my bird feeder. My husband and I love to watch sports on TV together—especially baseball. I wear 3L of oxygen when I am sitting down and for the most part I feel okay when I am wearing it. Yes, I do get short of breath when I go places--but there aren’t many places that I need to go anymore. My friends and family visit me. My husband has taken over cooking and doing the laundry. And you know what--he is pretty good at it! </p>

  <p>I have everything that I need right here. My husband keeps my spirits up and at least one of my kids comes once a week to visit me. I thought about getting a lung transplant. But it wasn’t right for me. I have never been much of a risk taker and after learning about it-I felt as if there were too many things that could go wrong. I don’t mind wearing oxygen and I am good at taking my medications. I can do pretty much everything that I want right now, so why would I take a risk with a surgery that won’t necessarily help me live longer?</p>
