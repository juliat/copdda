  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon stressfulProcess">Video 1: Jack–I just had my birthday</h3>
  <p>I just celebrated my one year anniversary from my lung transplant. This year has definitely been an experience. 1 year ago, I couldn’t walk across the room without getting short of breath.  It took a while to get strong, but now I am taking walks with my friends and I am even planning on playing golf with my husband.  </p>
  
  <p>Yes, it has been good to get back out there.  But it is not like I got a transplant and I could go on living a normal life.  I have a lot of side effects from the medications. My hands tremor all the time—worse than it did when I took my COPD medications.  I never know if it is from my tacrolimus (one of my transplant meds) or from my sugars  Yep, transplant did that to me too. I never had high sugars before, but I have it now.  I have to give myself insulin shots and I have to watch what I eat. </p>
  
  <p>My skin is so sensitive to the sun now—I swear, if I go outside for 15 minutes I get a sunburn.  My doctor says that I have to be really careful because I am at a really high risk of skin cancer because I take the transplant medications.  He even told me to see a skin doctor every 6 months for regular check ups.    </p>
  
  <p>Probably the worse side effect that I had from the medications is diarrhea.  I had it so badly that I didn’t want to leave the house.  My doctors finally helped me get it under control but it still isn’t normal.</p>
  
  <p>Besides that, I’ve just had to be good about managing things after transplant. I’m not allowed to be around anyone who’s sick because the drugs that make my body not attack my new lungs also make it really easy for me to get sick, and really hard for my body to fight off any sickness. That’s also why I’m supposed to be extra careful about germs. I carry around hand sanitizer and wet wipes. I wipe things like restaurant menus down before I touch them.</p>
  
  <p>There’s a lot to keep track of. It’s not like I got a transplant and poof, all better. It really is trading one disease for another. With COPD I had oxygen and I worried about not being able to breathe or getting pneumonia, I went to the hospital when I had flare-ups. Now, after transplant, I still have loads of pills to take, and I worry about getting infections, and I go to the hospital if the doctors think my body’s starting to reject the lungs. I’m still grateful that I got my transplant, and I’d do it again, but believe me, it ain’t easy.</p>
  
  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 2: Kate—Dad never did well </h3>
  <p>My dad never did well after his lung transplant. The doctors couldn’t get him off of the breathing machine.  It seemed as if he always had an infection or rejection.  He never wanted to be kept alive on a machine, but after waiting so long for his lungs we struggled with throwing in the towel.  The doctors said that he had a bad infection in his lungs that was hard to kill off.  The doctors gave him the strongest drugs that they could.   His kidneys stopped working and he had to be started on dialysis.  There are days that he would look better and he would “wean” or took him off of the breathing machine for a bit.  Then the next day he would be sick again and had to be hooked back up to the machine. He was in bed for so long that he started to get bed sores.  They really hurt him.   It was hard to see how anxious he was.  I know that he had nightmares—I mean really bad nightmares.  He finally passed away from a really bad pneumonia.  He told us that he didn’t want to keep fighting.  He had been in the hospital for just under a year. </p>
