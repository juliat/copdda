  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3>Video 1: What does “COPD” stand for?</h3>
  <p>COPD is a very common lung disease. In the United States, it is the fourth most common cause of death. People can get COPD from years of smoking, from being exposed to chemical fumes or air pollution, or from having many lung infections as a child.</p>
  <p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Here is what each word in that name means:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chronic</strong>: long-lasting</li>
    <li><strong>Obstructive</strong>: like the word obstacle—something that creates blockages</li>
    <li><strong>Pulmonary</strong>: related to lungs</li>
    <li><strong>Disease</strong>: a medical condition</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Though the name can be confusing, once you know what each word means, it makes sense: COPD is a long-lasting disease that creates blockages in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.</p>

  <p>One important thing to know is that COPD is one word for two diseases. People with COPD almost always have both <em>emphysema</em> and <em>chronic bronchitis</em> to some degree, which is why COPD is used to abbreviate both. However, emphysema and chronic bronchitis affect different parts of the lungs.</p>

  <h3>Video 2: What is Chronic Bronchitis?</h3>
  <p>Like the last video explained, COPD is one word for two diseases. The first disease we’ll talk about is “chronic bronchitis.”</p>
  <p><em>Bronchial tubes</em> are tubes that branch off of your windpipe and let air travel from your windpipe into your lungs.</p>
  <p><em>Bronchitis</em> is the name for what happens when those tubes become swollen. This swelling can also be called <em>“inflammation.”</em> That <em>inflammation</em> leads to the build up of mucus in the tube, which blocks them and makes it harder to breathe. People with chronic bronchitis also cough a lot, and cough up mucus. </p>

  <h3>Video 3: What is Emphysema?</h3>
  <p>The second disease that is part of COPD is emphysema. While chronic bronchitis affects the tubes in your lungs, emphysema affects the air sacs.</p>
  <p>At the end of the <em>bronchial tubes</em>, there are bunches of tiny air sacs called <em>alveoli</em>. When you inhale, oxygen enters your <em>alveoli</em>. Tiny blood vessels that surround your <em>alveoli</em> carry the oxygen away to your body.</p>
  <p>When you have emphysema, you have fewer <em>alveoli</em>. This means that it is harder for oxygen to soak into your bloodstream. Also, your <em>alveoli</em> become less elastic. This means that air cannot move in and out of your <em>alveoli</em> easily. Both of these things make it harder for oxygen to get into your bloodstream and makes you short of breath.</p>
