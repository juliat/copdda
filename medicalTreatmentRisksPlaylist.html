  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon shortOfBreath">Video 1: Kaitlyn</h3>
  
  <h3 class="icon needOxygen">Video 2: Joseph—I have to wear oxygen still</h3>
  <p>Y’know, I do manage my COPD pretty well. I haven’t had any flare-ups for a good long while. But one thing that still bugs me is having to tote around a tank of oxygen with me wherever I go. I hate walking into a public place and feeling like everyone’s watching me—looking at me like I’m contagious! When I first went on oxygen, one of my friends was worried that I would get them sick! And besides that, it’s a nuisance. Stairs are hard enough when it’s hard to breathe, but I hate having to lug the tank up the stairs with me. Now I’m looking into getting a portable oxygen concentrator—it takes oxygen out of the air, so you don’t have to refill it, and it’s lighter. But they’re pricey, and I’ll have to talk to my insurance company about covering the cost of that.</p>
  
  <h3 class="icon independenceLimited">Video 3: Stella—I still need my COPD meds</h3>
  <p>I do take a lot of medicines every day. I’m on oxygen all the time, 1 puffer every four hours and I use a disk once a day. I also have a nebulizer for times when I get really short of breath. It’s a hassle to keep track of all of them, and spend time taking them, but it’s what I have to do. </p>

  <h3 class="icon MTmightNotWork">Video 4: Dave—hates having to depend on others</h3>
  <p>I have had COPD for 11 years. For the past 3, I am so short of breath—it is hard to leave the house. I used to be very active. I used to volunteer at my church and the local VFW. I used to be the one that helped people. But, now people have to help me. My daughter works-but she still finds time to do all my grocery shopping. She calls and gets the list, brings it to me, and puts it away. More recently, I had to hire a lady to help with my housework because I can’t do the big stuff anymore. I still go to church, but my church group takes turns driving <strong>me </strong>there and back. That is hard for a 65 year old guy to take some times.</p>
  
  <h3 class="icon independenceLimited">Video 5: Brian—you can die from COPD</h3>
  <p>I was my dad’s caretaker ever since he was diagnosed with COPD. That was 7 years ago. His doctor’s did their best to treat him, and he did everything they asked him to do. He did okay for awhile, but he caught pneumonia, and everybody missed it until it was too late. He was in such distress when I found him. I called 911 right away and the paramedics put a breathing tube in his mouth as soon as they got to our house. He always said he wasn't afraid to die, that he was afraid to suffer. He was on a breathing machine for 1 week before he passed away. It doesn’t seem fair that this happened so suddenly—even when we were listening to everything the doctors told us to do. I miss him so much.</p>
