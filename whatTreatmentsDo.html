  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>

  <h3>Video 1: Medical Therapy</h3>
  <p>There is no cure for COPD. This means that there is no medicine which will heal the damage to your lungs. Medical therapy can help you feel better and may help you from getting worse. Let’s talk about some typical medications that patients with COPD take:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bronchodilators</strong> are a kind of medicine that you breathe in using an inhaler or nebulizer machine. They relax the muscles inside of your lungs so that it’s easier to breathe.</li>
    <li><strong>Steroids</strong> are a kind of medicine that you take through an inhaler. They make the air tubes in your lungs less swollen, so that more air can get through.</li>
    <li><strong>Oxygen therapy</strong>  is you breathe pure oxygen through a mask or through tubes in your nose <em>(nasal cannula)</em>. Normal air isn’t pure oxygen. Oxygen therapy helps because it makes it easier for your lungs to get oxygen into your blood. Having more oxygen may help you feel less short of breath.</li>
    <li><strong>Flu and pneumonia vaccines</strong> help prevent the flu and pneumonia. This is important because if a person with COPD gets the flu or pneumonia, they can end up in the hospital for a long time or even die.</li>
    <li><strong>Exercise</strong> helps strengthen your breathing muscles, so that breathing is easier. It also strengthens your whole body so you're less likely to hurt yourself by accident.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Taking these medicines and exercising may make you feel better but does not stop the disease from getting worse. Over time, your COPD will get worse. You may need more oxygen and find it hard to walk even a couple of steps. You may need to spend more time in the hospital than you do now. You may even get so sick that a breathing machine is necessary to keep you alive.</p>

  <h3>Video 2: Lung Transplantation</h3>
  <p>A lung transplant is when one or both of your lungs are removed and replaced with lungs from a deceased organ donor. Lung transplantation can make breathing easier and may let you go without oxygen again. Some patients go back to work, travel or are able to be active with their family.</p>

  <p>Lung transplantation is very risky though. You can die in surgery or shortly after it. You can also end up in the hospital for weeks or months after the surgery. You will need to take a lot medications to stay healthy and to prevent your body from attacking the new lungs (rejection). These are called immunosupression medications—they lower your body’s defenses so that your body doesn’t attack the new lungs. These medications have many side effects. Some of the common side effects that you may get are nausea, diarrhea, infections, high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems and cancer.</p>
