<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>I got a transplant 2 years ago and it’s been wonderful. The biggest change is that I no longer have to carry an oxygen tank everywhere. I can breathe normally and it feels wonderful. I used to feel suffocated all the time, like I was breathing through a straw. I would panic multiple times during the day because I would get the feeling that I was suffocating. But now, I can get around the house - do the dishes, cook, garden. I can walk take my dog for a walk again. I have my freedom back.</p>
