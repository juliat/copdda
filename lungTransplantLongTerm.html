  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 1: Ken </h3>
  <p>It’s been 5 years since I’ve got my transplant.  It took years before I finally got the call that there were lungs that were a good fit for me. I was one of the lucky ones.  I sailed through the lung transplant surgery and went home within 2 weeks.  The doctors said that it was because I went to pulmonary rehab and was so strong going into the surgery.</p>

  <p>The first two years weren’t easy, but they weren’t awful.  I had to learn a lot about how to take care of myself.  I had spent a lot of time getting my labs drawn, my pulmonary function tests measured and visiting with my doctor.  I had to stay overnight in the hospital several times for rejection, but I always made it out in one piece. </p>

  <p>The best part of getting a lung transplant was that I was able to travel with my wife again.  We have gone down to Florida every year for the last 3 years now.  I have also gotten to know my grandchildren. I saw my oldest grandson graduate from high school and I held my youngest granddaughter just hours after she was born.  Just think, I might not have met her if I hadn’t had a transplant.   </p>

  <h3 class="icon expensive">Video 2: Bob–I have BOS and kidney failure. </h3>
  <p>I got my lung transplant about 6 years ago. I did really well for the first 3 years.  In the first year, I actually went out hunting again and got a 10point buck. It felt so good to be able to walk the hills in our woods again.  I also travelled with my wife. We went to Italy and we took trips to Florida in the winter.  Life was good.  </p>
  
  <p>I took all my medications the way my doctors told me I should. I never missed a lab or a clinic visit.  I measured my home spirometry every day and I kept a log of all of my vital signs.  My doctor called me their star patient. </p>

  <p>Although I did everything right, I developed something called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome –some people call it BOS for short. My doctors told me that BOS causes scarring in the lungs.  There are a few things that they have tried to make the scarring slow down, but it hasn’t helped.  My doctors told me that they don’t have many options for me.  I feel like I have COPD again.  I am back on oxygen. It is hard to walk.  I have been in the hospital twice for a pneumonia this year.  </p>

  <p>Also, about 6 months ago my legs started swelling up and I felt tired.  My doctor told me that the immunosuppression medications that I take are really hard on my kidneys and that I had signs of kidney failure.  The medications that I take are really hard on the kidneys. At first I could get the fluid off with pills, but then I stopped going to the bathroom completely.  I have to go to dialysis s three times a week for 4 hours. At dialysis they hook me up to a machine that filters my blood. I am always exhausted by the end of it. All I wanted to do was to sleep. </p>

  <p>Even though I feel sick again, I wouldn’t trade the 5 good years that I have had with my family.  </p>
